# the python contains  the ref count for the number 
# every datatypes are in the memory 
# inside the memory the dataype is there 

# the python do the garbage collection of the numbers late 

# see python behaviour of the python is based on the refrences 

# if you give one refrence to the list then the list is the mutual with the list which is refrenced 

# if the lists contains the more than one rferences then the particular list is immutuable 

# h1=[1,2,3,] , h2[:] this is the example of the sclicing

# see this syntax checks the memory refrences ex m is m
